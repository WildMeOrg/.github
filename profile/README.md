# Wild Me
At Wild Me, we believe that conservation is a life-saving effort that everyone should be able to contribute to. We're dedicated to open source software that works to reverse the sixth mass extinction. Believe in the cause? Want to help? Whether you donate your time to the projects directly, or help us keep the lights on with a [financial contribution](https://secure.givelively.org/donate/conservation-x-labs-inc/wild-me), we're happy to have you as part of the team!

## Community and Contributions
Wild Me uses the PR workflow common to many Git projects. Contributes fork the project, create changes locally on branches, then request the that the original repo pull from the local branch.

The resulting pull request (PR) is then reviewed by other contributors. At present, the bulk of reviewing is done by the Wild Me team, but we are working to expand this as our regular contributor numbers grow.

Reviewed PRs will be approved and merged in by the Wild Me team, rejected outright (this is typically only done with code that is in flagrant disregard of styles or that does not contribute to the software/organizational goals), or have requests for changes.

Contributors looking for support can join the [Wild Me Development Discord](https://discord.gg/zw4tr3RE4R).
